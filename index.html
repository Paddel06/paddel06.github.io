  <p>
    Welcome to my little site.<br>
    The main goal of this is to provide an extensive, but easy to understand resource for all things Vita and hacking it.<br>
    It is inspired by the <a href="https://vita.hacks.guide/">vita.hacks.guide</a>, but I have added and changed some things that I wasn't quite satisfied with on their site.<br>
    I am especially trying to make clear why certain things are done the way they are, so users better understand how everything works. Also, pictures!<br>	
    Sorry if this site looks like ass, but I suck at webdev. It was created using my fifth grade HTML knowledge and referencing <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>.<br>
    Available in English and German (soon).
