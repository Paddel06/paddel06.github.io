    Creating an internal memory card on 1xxx models with firmware 3.60 or below:  
    0. The Vita **has** to be on firmware **3.60 or below**. Anything above **will** require an official memory card and you will not be able to continue with this method.  
    1. If you are not on firmware 3.60 yet, set your primary DNS in the advanced network settings to `212.47.229.76`, reboot, and then just update normally (it should show **3.60** as the latest firmware. If not, check the settings again).  
    2. Insert an sd2vita that was prepared using <https://vita.hacks.guide/storage-format-(windows).html> into the Vita.  
    3. Visit `vitawiki.xyz/tf` in the browser on the Vita and let it install Henkaku and molecularshell.  
      Open the Settings App and go to `HENkaku Settings > Enable Unsafe Homebrew`.  
    4. Open the newly installed molecularshell and press select, connect to your PC using any FTP client like WinSCP or FileZilla, and install IMCUnlock (<https://github.com/SKGleba/IMCUnlock/releases/latest>) on the Vita.  
      Open IMCUnlock and select either the `100mb` or `default 2xxx` option.  
      - Note that the `2xxx` option will additionally require you to factory reset the Vita once to fully work correctly.  
      After the Vita reboots, open Settings and go to `Format > Format Memory Card` and format the newly created 100mb("0gb")/1gb internal memory card.  
    5. Now you can follow <https://vita.hacks.guide/> to hack your Vita, and don't have to worry about anything. For all intents and purposes, the Vita now works like a 2xxx/Slim model.
