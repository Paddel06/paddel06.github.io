    How to permanently disable IDU (Demo) mode on the PS Vita:  
    1. Turn off the Vita, plug it into power. This should automatically turn it back on.  
    2. Hold `L + R + DPad Up + Start` for a few seconds to temporarily disable IDU mode.  
      This will disable IDU mode *for five minutes*.  
    3. Put the Vita into sleep and wait until the light blinks and turns off, then unplug it and wake it back up.  
      This will keep IDU mode disabled *until the next reboot*, so you don't have to worry about it turning back on while doing the rest of this procedure.  
    4. Follow <https://vita.hacks.guide/> until you have Vitadeploy on the Vita, open it, and go into `Miscellaneous > Disable IDU Mode`.  
      This will disable IDU mode *permanently* and the Vita is now just like any other normal one.  
    5. Now just continue with the rest of the guide as usual to fully hack your Vita and make the most of it.
