    Plugins are like small add-ons that run in the background and enhance or add features.  

    How to install a plugin on the Vita:  
    0. DON'T USE AUTOPLUGIN. YES, THIS ALSO INCLUDES AUTOPLUGIN 2, EASYPLUGIN, OR ANYTHING SIMILAR.  
    1. Place the plugin file (.s**u**prx or .s**k**prx) in **ur0**:tai/.  
      -Using **ux0**:tai/config.txt is not recommended, no matter what any readme tells you. In general, it is best to have all plugins in one place.  
      -You cannot access the ur0: partition via USB, so either just use FTP to transfer the plugin, or place it on the memory card / sd2vita via USB and use Vitashell to move it from there to ur0:tai then.  
    2. Add a line with the plugin's path to the config.txt in ur0:tai/. Example: `ur0:tai/pluginname.skprx` under the appropriate section.  
      -In general, .s**k**prx files always go under the `*KERNEL` section and .s**u**prx files usually under either `*main` or `*ALL`. If in doubt, check the plugin readme on github or wherever you got the plugin from.  
    3. Reboot the Vita to load the plugin.  

    Some plugins may require further setup, but these are the basic steps that are part of every plugin installation and that are enough in 90% of cases. If plugins require further setup, this is usually described in their readme.  

    If you have a plugin causing issues, you can skip the loading of all plugins by holding L during the boot process. You can also skip plugin loading per application by holding L (L1 on PSTV) while opening that application.  
      -Skipping plugins on boot on a PSTV is a bit more complicated and requires you to have taiHEN 0.12.0 or newer installed (included with the VitaDeploy method). For more info, check <https://forum.devchroma.nl/index.php?topic=334.0>.  

    If you have a config.txt in **ux0**:tai/, the config.txt in **ur0**:tai/ will be ignored, causing plugins that are loaded from that config to not work.
